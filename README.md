# Inverted-Pendulum
Balance and swing-up an inverted pendulum attaching to a cart which is driven by a DC motor with Cascade PID controller which keep the cart stay around the middle of the rail.
This project was conducted based on two method:
  -  Using Arduino Uno to programing
  -  Using Arduino support package from MATLAB/Simulink to generate and deploy code from Simulink control model
